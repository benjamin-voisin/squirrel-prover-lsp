A name declaration name name_id : typei -&gt;? types introduces a new name symbol name_id optionally indexed by typei and sampling values of type types.
Whenever a name n is defined, a corresponding namelength axiom is declared as:
It states that all names have the same length, given by a constant.
It is required that the indexing type typei is a finite type, but there are no restrictions over the sampling type types.
The sampling distribution used over the sampling type types is usually arbitrary â€” though it can be restricted using type tags.
