Add a rewriting rule from the lemma ident to the user-defined rewriting database. The lemma should establish a local formula consisting of a universally quantified conditional equality. In other words, it should essentially be of the form forall binders, phi_1 =&gt; ... =&gt; phi_n =&gt; u = v.
The goal will be used to rewrite occurrences of u into the corresponding occurrences of v, assuming the conditions phi_1, ..., phi_n reduce to true (using Reduction).
